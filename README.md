# Scientific Calculator

A fully functional scientific calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This calculator offers a wide range of mathematical functions including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, powers, and more.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Advanced mathematical functions: 
  - Trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan)
  - Logarithms (log, ln)
  - Exponents and Powers
  - Square Root
  - Factorial
  - Memory functions (M+, M-, MR)
- Clear functionality (`AC`, `CE`)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Stylish and interactive UI with hover effects

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Adds the styling and responsiveness to the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic behind the calculatorâ€™s functions and interactions.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [Scientific Calculator Website](https://scientific-calc-five.vercel.app/)
2. Enter numbers and choose operations from the keypad.
3. Use the trigonometric, logarithmic, or other scientific functions for advanced calculations.
4. Clear the current input using `CE` or reset all inputs using `AC`.

### Example Calculations:

- **Basic Arithmetic**: `5 + 3 * 2` results in `11`.
- **Trigonometry**: `sin(30)` calculates the sine of 30 degrees.
- **Logarithms**: `log(100)` returns the logarithm base 10 of 100.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding support for additional advanced functions (e.g., integration and differentiation).
- Enhancing UI/UX with more themes and customization options.
- Localization support for different languages.
